	<p class="intro">Hey everyone, I'm Fin. Currently, I am a student at Hendrix College and majoring in computer science. This blog was made as a lab assignment for one of my programming classes, and I actually really like the idea (especially if I get to control who sees it). </p>
	<p>This blog is probably only going to be about what I'm up to in that class, but who knows? There could always be something completely unrelated happening. Because of that though, I doubt it'll be reaching a large audience. As for the current audience, it'll consist of my professor for the course, my parents, and perhaps my peers.
	But thats about it. I go to school, I do (mostly) normal things, and I live. So stay tuned for the blog, yeah?  
	Fin</p>
