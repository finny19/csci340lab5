	<p>Outside of class, I consider my life to be not-the-most-exciting. I play games, go out to Walmart with my friends, and collect and classify occlupanids. You don't have to google that, occlupanids are bread clips (I've been fascinated with them since I was 16). All of the currently discovered bread clips are seperated into "species," and there is a running joke that they are actually alive and are symbiotic parasites that feed on bread bags.</p>
