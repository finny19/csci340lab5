Hey all (three of you)! Welcome back. If you saw how the site originally looked, I hope you prefer this way a lot more. If you didn't: I changed the background color from a blinding white to this cool gray-blue, and the text obviously had to become lighter so you could still see it. I also changed the font to [Titillum Web](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web?preview.text=Fin%27s%20Silly%20Little%20Blog&preview.text_type=custom), or at least I think I did, it looks super similar. I also, as a little quality of life updated, went on and underlined clickable links, and made previously clicked links a purple color for ease of distinction. If you wanted see how it looked last time, this is it.

Yeah, I know, what a horrible assault to the eyes. I'm sorry. I definitely didn't know how to add images in markdown whan I started on this lab, so I just wanted to give a shout out to my favorite markdown syntax one-stop-site, [the Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images-1)!!

Now I also wanted to point out that if you spent more than a second looking at the photo proof of how inhuman this blog once looked, you may have noticed that up on the top it *only* had an "About" section, well that is no longer the case! For now and forever, you can decide to take a peek into my interests page, or even have a quick look at my course curriculum.

Well, that's really all I wanted to say... but I still need to include another image. In that case, enjoy a picture of my dog, Ace! What a good looking boy... ![Ace](/assets/images/ace.jpg "Ace, my dog")
