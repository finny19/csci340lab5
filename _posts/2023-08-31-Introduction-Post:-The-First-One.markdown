In the process of setting up this blog, there were a lot of new things I experienced. Some were relatively easy to grasp, but others were most definitely not. I think it'll be easiest to start off by listing the easy parts, such as forking the repository, making it local, and then the parts of actually editing the original information in the blog to be what I needed them to be.  

By far, the toughest part of this whole thing was absolutely installing Ruby. There was a whole **list** of actions I had to take to get it on my computer, which was:  

1. [Install Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) - This was not a step I was aware I had to do. Thanks to my dad for helping me to figure this out. I used the "Untar Anywhere" under "Alternative Installs" wat to install it, putting in the first and third parts of the code into terminal.  
2. Install Ruby RVM Version - I did this the way that Jeffery Morgan explained how to on [his website](https://jeffreymorgan.io/articles/ruby-on-macos-with-rvm/). I went down to the "Installing RVM and Ruby" part, which was working well until the last of the three commands.  
3. Figure out I actually already had Ruby, or that I at least had it before I put in the last command of the above mentioned commands. This was dicovered by typing the "which ruby" command into terminal, and getting a response that confirmed I already had it.  

After that, it was all smooth sailing, and I finished the lab work. I am pretty happy with how this turned out, even though I only followed instructions and all. I am excited about it though, this is the first website I've made that I think I can identify with. [My first website](http://finny19.github.io/csci340lab1) was cool and all, but it's not something I'm all too proud with. I think I will continue to feel proud about this one though, so, here's to my new blog!
